    "The objective of this HW is to explore a real-life data set, and perfom exploratory data analysis (EDA) on it. Real data sets tend to be large, complex (a lot of heterogenous variables/features, many with unclear semantics), noisy (including outliers), incompplete (a lot of missing values), redundant (duplicated data) and generally messy. It is no surprise then that according to some sources 80% of a data scientist's time is spent collecting, cleaning and wrangling data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set contains house sales data in the previous few years from CA. I have usually given [this data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income) for EDA when I have taught this class earlier. It is a nice data set, but it is old, curated and quite clean as far as real data sets are concerned. So I was quite excited when I discovered this publicly available, rich data set, and decided it would be a good exposure to real data sets, typically seen in the industry (although mostly the data sets remain private).\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set was scrapped from a site, such as Zillow or Redfin by Alex Smola's team for a [course](https://c.d2l.ai/stanford-cs329p/) at Stanford. [This site](https://c.d2l.ai/stanford-cs329p/_static/notebooks/cs329p_notebook_eda.slides.html) shows some EDA on this data set. Please go through it. Some of the steps there are repeated here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objectives of exploratory analyses is to get a sense of what the data looks like; how good is the data quality; explore relationships between variables. You may even have some preconceived notions of how different features look like; you can treat these as hypotheses and then try to figure out from the data if they really hold. \n",

    "It takes about half a minute to read the file on my machine, which is not too bad since we only need to do it once. If it were a larger file (say 10x) then it would be a problem. There is another file format called [feather](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/feather.html) which saves dataframes (usually compressed) to files and is much faster in loading. (One drawback compared to csv is that it is a binary file, so you can't just less it to see its content or edit it ith a text editor.)\n",
